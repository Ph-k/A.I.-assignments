### Implementation of some artificial intelligence algorithms as a part of an AI course at DIT - UoA.
 
*Projects 1 & 2 are basically berkeley's [cs188 Pac-Man](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp19/) projects.*

**Project 1:**

In the folder of the first project you will find the implementation of various search algorithms (DFS, BFS, UCS, A*). Which are used to help Pac-Man win.  Also you will find various heuristics, which are mainly used in combination with the A* algorithm, and aid to improve the overall performance of the program.

**Project 2:**

In the folder of the second project you will find the implementation of a reflex agent (see `evaluationFunction()`), as well as implementations of the minimax and expectimax algorithms along with some improvements such as Alpha-Beta pruning.

Projects 1 & 2 passed the autograder, with grades 26/25 and 25/25 respectively.

Projects 1 & 2 execution commands are the same as in the berkeley projects ([1]([Project 1 - Search - CS 188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, Spring 2019 (berkeley.edu)](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp19/project1.html)),[2](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp19/project2.html)).
